### The project still pre-alpha so there is a lot of issues 

you need to have python3 and pip3 installed 
you can check by typing `python3 --version` and `pip3 --version`
if not installed [download from here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

`pip3 install -r requirements.txt` 

get your telegram bot api code from BotFather
and your private and public keys from binance 

Create a `api.py` file.
the formate should be like below, 
add your keys 
``` 
bot_api = 'Telegram Bot API'

binance_api_key = ''
binance_api_secret = '' 
```

and you should be good to go 

in analyzer.py you can close the functions for optimal view

to run it `python3 file.py`
